# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-focused Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tool that combines the intuitive interface design of tools like Obsidian and Logseq with advanced AI capabilities for multimodal document processing, embeddings, RAG retrieval, and knowledge graph construction. The system will consist of a Python FastAPI backend and a React frontend with ShadCN UI components and Tailwind styling, designed for easy single-user deployment without complex user management systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to create, edit, and organize notes in a familiar interface similar to Obsidian or Logseq, so that I can efficiently manage my personal knowledge without a steep learning curve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with note navigation and a main editor pane
2. WHEN a user creates a new note THEN the system SHALL provide a markdown editor with real-time preview capabilities
3. WHEN a user saves a note THEN the system SHALL persist the note content and update the navigation sidebar
4. WHEN a user searches for notes THEN the system SHALL provide fuzzy search functionality across all note content
5. IF a user creates wiki-style links [[note-name]] THEN the system SHALL automatically create bidirectional links between notes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to upload and process multimodal documents (text, images, PDFs, audio), so that I can extract knowledge from various content types and integrate them into my knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL process it using RAG-Anything for content extraction
2. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for semantic search capabilities
3. WHEN processing multimodal content THEN the system SHALL extract text from images, transcribe audio
4. WHEN a PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content and display the PDF in a viewer interface
5. IF a document processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
6. WHEN document processing completes THEN the system SHALL automatically create notes with extracted content and metadata

### Requirement 2.1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to view PDF documents within the application interface, so that I can reference them while working with related notes without switching between applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a PDF reference THEN the system SHALL display the PDF in an embedded viewer
2. WHEN viewing a PDF THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls for page browsing
3. WHEN a PDF is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the original formatting and layout
4. WHEN a user searches within a PDF THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text within the document
5. IF a PDF cannot be displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a download option as fallback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a knowledge seeker, I want to perform semantic search and RAG-based retrieval across my knowledge base, so that I can find relevant information even when I don't remember exact keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search query THEN the system SHALL return semantically relevant results using embedding-based similarity
2. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL use RAG retrieval to provide contextual answers from the knowledge base
3. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL show relevance scores and source note references
4. IF no relevant results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or related concepts
5. WHEN a user interacts with search results THEN the system SHALL allow direct navigation to source notes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a knowledge explorer, I want to visualize and navigate a knowledge graph of my notes and concepts, so that I can discover connections and patterns in my knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes notes and documents THEN it SHALL automatically build a knowledge graph showing relationships between concepts
2. WHEN a user views the knowledge graph THEN the system SHALL display nodes representing notes, PDFs, and other documents with edges representing relationships
3. WHEN a user clicks on a graph node THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding note or document viewer
4. WHEN new notes or documents are added THEN the system SHALL update the knowledge graph in real-time
5. WHEN PDFs are processed THEN they SHALL be included as nodes in the knowledge graph with extracted concepts
6. IF the knowledge graph becomes complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and clustering options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a self-hosting user, I want to easily deploy the PKM tool on my own infrastructure, so that I can maintain full control over my data without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to deploy the system THEN they SHALL be able to use Docker containers for both backend and frontend
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for environment setup and configuration
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically initialize required databases and storage systems
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL support 2-3 concurrent users without performance degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all my data to remain on my own infrastructure without external user management systems, so that I can ensure complete data privacy and control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL operate without requiring external authentication services
2. WHEN accessing the application THEN users SHALL have full access to all features without login requirements
3. WHEN data is processed THEN all embeddings and AI processing SHALL occur locally or through user-configured services
4. IF external AI services are used THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure their own API keys and endpoints
5. WHEN storing data THEN all notes, documents, and metadata SHALL remain within the user's deployment environment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a clean API architecture with FastAPI backend and React frontend, so that I can easily extend and customize the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is implemented THEN it SHALL use FastAPI with clear REST API endpoints
2. WHEN the frontend is built THEN it SHALL use React with ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS styling
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow modern React patterns with proper state management
4. IF customization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between UI components and business logic
5. WHEN the API is accessed THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
