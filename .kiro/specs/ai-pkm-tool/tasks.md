# Implementation Plan

## Source Control and Commit Guidelines

This implementation plan includes regular commits throughout development to maintain proper version control and track progress. Each major task includes a suggested commit message following conventional commit format:

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Commit Frequency:**
- Commit after completing each sub-task within a major task
- Create intermediate commits for significant progress within tasks
- Always commit working, tested code
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "what" and "why"

**Branch Strategy:**
- Use feature branches for each major task (e.g., `feature/rag-integration`, `feature/frontend-setup`)
- Create pull requests for code review before merging to main
- Tag releases at major milestones (e.g., `v0.1.0-backend-complete`, `v0.2.0-frontend-complete`)

##
 Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] Clean up temp_lightrag folder
  - Remove the temp_lightrag Git repository from the project root
  - This folder contains a cloned LightRAG repository used for reference during development
  - LightRAG integration should be done via proper Python package installation (pip install lightrag-hku)
  - Either delete the folder or move it outside the project to avoid Git submodule issues
  - _Note: This was causing Git warnings during commits due to embedded repository_
