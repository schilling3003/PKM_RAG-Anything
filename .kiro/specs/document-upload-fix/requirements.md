# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI PKM Tool is missing several critical dependencies and services required for full functionality. The document upload feature is failing with a 500 Internal Server Error due to missing Redis and Celery worker setup. Additionally, advanced features like knowledge graph construction, semantic search, and multimodal document processing are not working due to missing dependencies including LightRAG, MinerU 2.0, and proper AI model configuration. This spec addresses the complete setup of all required services and dependencies for full system functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through the web interface, so that I can add them to my personal knowledge management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags and drops a file onto the upload area THEN the system SHALL accept the file and begin processing
2. WHEN a user clicks the upload button and selects a file THEN the system SHALL accept the file and begin processing
3. WHEN a file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with upload confirmation
4. WHEN a file upload fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message explaining the failure
5. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL queue it for background processing using Celery

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Celery task processing to work correctly, so that uploaded documents are processed in the background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the Celery worker SHALL connect to Redis successfully
2. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL create a Celery task for processing
3. WHEN a Celery task is created THEN it SHALL be queued in Redis for background processing
4. WHEN a Celery task fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and update the document status appropriately
5. WHEN the Celery configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and fix upload issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error with sufficient detail
2. WHEN a Celery task fails THEN the system SHALL capture and log the exception
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message
4. WHEN file validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
5. WHEN the upload directory is not accessible THEN the system SHALL create it or return an appropriate error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of my document uploads, so that I know when processing is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a task ID for tracking
2. WHEN I query the upload status THEN the system SHALL return the current processing status
3. WHEN document processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the status to "completed"
4. WHEN document processing fails THEN the system SHALL update the status to "failed" with error details
5. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show progress information if available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced document processing capabilities, so that I can extract maximum value from my uploaded documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a PDF THEN the system SHALL use RAG-Anything with MinerU 2.0 for advanced text extraction
2. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL process it with vision models for content analysis
3. WHEN I upload audio/video THEN the system SHALL transcribe it using appropriate models
4. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL extract structured data like tables and figures
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL store results in appropriate formats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want semantic search and knowledge graph features, so that I can discover relationships between my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for semantic search
2. WHEN I perform a search THEN the system SHALL return semantically relevant results
3. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL build knowledge graph relationships
4. WHEN I query the system THEN LightRAG SHALL provide intelligent RAG-based responses
5. WHEN I explore my knowledge base THEN the system SHALL show document relationships

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all required services and dependencies properly installed, so that the system functions at full capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN Redis SHALL be running and accessible
2. WHEN the system starts THEN Celery workers SHALL be running and processing tasks
3. WHEN the system starts THEN LightRAG SHALL be installed and functional
4. WHEN the system starts THEN RAG-Anything with MinerU 2.0 SHALL be installed and configured
5. WHEN AI features are used THEN OpenAI API integration SHALL work if configured

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive setup documentation and scripts, so that I can easily deploy and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN there SHALL be clear installation instructions
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN there SHALL be automated setup scripts
3. WHEN configuring services THEN there SHALL be environment variable documentation
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN there SHALL be health check endpoints and logs
5. WHEN deploying THEN there SHALL be both local and Docker deployment options
