# AI-Focused Personal Knowledge Management Tool

A modern, self-hosted Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system that combines the intuitive interface patterns of Obsidian and Logseq with advanced AI capabilities for multimodal document processing, semantic search, and knowledge graph visualization.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **Document Management**: Complete upload, processing, and metadata management interface
- **Multimodal Document Processing**: Support for text, images, PDFs, audio, and video using RAG-Anything with MinerU 2.0
- **AI-Powered Search**: Semantic search and RAG-based question answering with multiple modes
- **Notes System**: Markdown editor with wiki-style linking and CRUD operations
- **Knowledge Graph Backend**: LightRAG-powered graph construction and querying
- **PDF Viewer**: Integrated PDF viewing with navigation, search, zoom, and annotation capabilities
- **Real-time Processing**: Background document processing with live status updates
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health check endpoints for all services
- **OpenAI Integration**: Complete integration with OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive backend testing with unit, integration, and load tests
- **Easy Deployment**: Docker-based deployment for single-user or small team use
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing occurs locally or through user-configured services

### ðŸš§ In Development
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Interactive D3.js-based graph visualization (backend ready)
- **Advanced Search Interface**: Unified search with filtering and result display

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time collaborative features
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching and query optimization
- **Frontend Testing**: Complete test coverage for React components

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with RAG-Anything, LightRAG, and MinerU 2.0
- **Frontend**: React with ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: SQLite for metadata, ChromaDB for vectors, NetworkX for graphs
- **Database**: Automated migration system for schema updates
- **Processing**: Celery + Redis for asynchronous document processing
