This is a comprehensive test document for end-to-end processing validation.

The document contains information about:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts
- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Knowledge Management Systems
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methodologies
- Vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities
- Knowledge graphs and entity relationship modeling

This document should be processed through the complete pipeline:
1. File upload and storage
2. RAG-Anything multimodal processing with MinerU
3. Text extraction and entity recognition
4. LightRAG knowledge graph construction
5. ChromaDB vector embedding generation
6. Semantic search indexing

The system should extract key entities like "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "RAG", "Knowledge Graphs", and create relationships between these concepts in the knowledge graph.

After processing, this document should be searchable through semantic queries and should contribute to RAG-based question answering about AI and ML topics.
