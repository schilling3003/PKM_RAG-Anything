This is a test document for the AI PKM Tool comprehensive testing.

The document contains information about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and knowledge management systems.

Key concepts covered:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) 
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Knowledge Graphs and semantic relationships
- Vector embeddings and similarity search

This document should be processed by the RAG-Anything framework with MinerU 2.0 for document extraction, indexed in the knowledge graph using LightRAG, and made searchable through semantic embeddings in ChromaDB.

The comprehensive testing suite validates all these components working together in the AI PKM Tool.
