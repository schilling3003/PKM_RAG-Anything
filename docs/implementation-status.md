- **Development Tools**: Hot reload, linting, and formatting

## In Progress ðŸš§

### Knowledge Graph Visualization (Task 9)
- **Backend**: Complete graph API with LightRAG integration
- **Frontend**: Placeholder component exists, D3.js visualization needed
- **Status**: Backend ready, frontend visualization pending

### PDF Viewer (Task 8.2)
- **Backend**: PDF processing implemented
- **Frontend**: View action exists but no viewer component
- **Status**: Backend ready, frontend viewer component needed

## Planned Features ðŸ“‹

### Search Interface (Task 10)
- Unified search interface with mode selection
- Advanced filtering and result display
- RAG answer presentation with source citations

### Real-time Features (Task 11)
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Real-time collaboration indicators
- Live search result updates

### Performance & Monitoring (Task 15)
- Query optimization and caching
- Application monitoring and logging
- Performance metrics collection

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Frontend Issues Fixed
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript parameter naming issues
- âœ… Updated deprecated `onKeyPress` to `onKeyDown`
- âœ… Fixed `useCallback` dependency arrays
- âœ… Replaced deprecated `substr` with `substring`

### Known Issues
- Some components have placeholder implementations
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Test coverage is incomplete

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **PDF Viewer Component** (High Priority)
   - Implement embedded PDF viewer with react-pdf or similar
   - Add navigation controls and search functionality
   - Connect to existing document view action

2. **Knowledge Graph Visualization** (High Priority)
   - Create D3.js-based interactive graph component
   - Implement node filtering and clustering
   - Add graph exploration features

3. **Search Interface** (Medium Priority)
   - Build unified search component
   - Implement result display with citations
   - Add advanced filtering options

## Development Notes

- All major backend services are functional and tested
- Frontend components follow ShadCN UI patterns consistently
- Real-time updates work for document processing status
- Docker development environment is stable and well-configured
- API documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

## Testing Status

- Backend: Basic functionality tests exist
- Frontend: Component structure is testable
- Integration: End-to-end testing framework needed
- Performance: Load testing not yet implemented
