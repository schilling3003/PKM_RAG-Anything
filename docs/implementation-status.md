## In Progress ðŸš§

### Knowledge Graph Visualization (Task 9)
- **Backend**: Complete graph API with LightRAG integration
- **Frontend**: Placeholder component exists, D3.js visualization needed
- **Status**: Backend ready, frontend visualization pending

## Planned Features ðŸ“‹

### Search Interface (Task 10)
- Unified search interface with mode selection
- Advanced filtering and result display
- RAG answer presentation with source citations

### Real-time Features (Task 11)
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Real-time collaboration indicators
- Live search result updates

### Performance & Monitoring (Task 15)
- Query optimization and caching
- Application monitoring and logging
- Performance metrics collection

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Frontend Issues Fixed
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript parameter naming issues
- âœ… Updated deprecated `onKeyPress` to `onKeyDown`
- âœ… Fixed `useCallback` dependency arrays
- âœ… Replaced deprecated `substr` with `substring`
- âœ… Added defensive programming for undefined data in sidebar component
- âœ… Improved async data handling in React components to prevent runtime errors

### Known Issues
- Some components have placeholder implementations
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Test coverage is incomplete

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Knowledge Graph Visualization** (High Priority)
   - Create D3.js-based interactive graph component
   - Implement node filtering and clustering
   - Add graph exploration features

2. **Search Interface** (High Priority)
   - Build unified search component
   - Implement result display with citations
   - Add advanced filtering options

3. **Real-time Updates** (Medium Priority)
   - WebSocket integration for live updates
   - Real-time collaboration indicators
   - Live search result updates

## Development Notes

- All major backend services are functional and tested
- Frontend components follow ShadCN UI patterns consistently
- Real-time updates work for document processing status
- Docker development environment is stable and well-configured
- API documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Mock data system implemented for frontend development and testing
- Automated database migration system handles schema updates seamlessly

## Mock Data for Development

The application includes a comprehensive mock data system located in `frontend/src/services/mock-data.ts` that provides:

### Mock Documents
- **PDF Files**: Sample PDFs with various processing states (completed, processing, failed, queued)
- **Office Documents**: Word and PowerPoint files with realistic metadata
- **Images**: PNG files with OCR text extraction examples
- **File Sizes**: Realistic file sizes from 1MB to 8MB
- **Processing States**: All possible document processing states represented

### Mock Processing Status
- Real-time processing progress simulation
- Current step tracking (e.g., "Generating embeddings")
- Error handling examples

### Mock Notes
- Sample markdown notes with titles and content
- Realistic timestamps and tag examples
- Demonstrates note structure and metadata

This mock data enables frontend development and testing without requiring a running backend, making the development process more efficient and allowing for consistent UI testing scenarios.

## Testing Status

- **Backend**: âœ… Comprehensive testing suite implemented
  - Unit tests for all health check endpoints
  - Integration tests for document processing pipeline
  - Error handling and recovery scenario tests
  - Service dependency failure tests
  - Load tests for concurrent processing
  - Real system validation tests
- **Frontend**: Component structure is testable, comprehensive tests pending
- **Integration**: End-to-end testing framework implemented for backend
- **Performance**: Load testing implemented and validated

## Recent Achievements

### Task 12: Comprehensive Testing Suite (Completed)
- âœ… Created 6 comprehensive test files (~3,300+ lines of test code)
- âœ… Fixed critical Celery task import issue
- âœ… Validated end-to-end document processing pipeline
- âœ… Confirmed OpenAI integration functionality
- âœ… Real system testing with 75% success rate
- âœ… All health endpoints working correctly

### System Status
- ðŸŸ¢ **Fully Operational**: All core services healthy and functional
