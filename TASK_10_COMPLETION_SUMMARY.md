python scripts/install-deps.py

# Run setup
python setup.py

# Start development
python scripts/start-dev.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Development environment
python scripts/start-docker.py --mode dev --build

# Production environment
python scripts/start-docker.py --mode prod --build
```

### Task Runner
```bash
# Using the task runner
python Makefile.py install
